<h1><strong>Multi-axis D3 Visualization<strong></h1>
<hr>
This project utilizes D3 to visualize U.S. state-based health data across a total of six axes (3 for each axis in the coordinate plan). In total, it offers 9 visualizations of the correlations between various health-related metrics.
Dataset

Objectives

Step 1


1. Create a new repository for this project called `D3-Challenge`. DONE 

2. Clone the new repository to your computer. DONE

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the D3 challenge. Use the folder name to correspond to the challenge: **D3_data_journalism**. DONE

4. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab. DONE

5. You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables. DONE

6. create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. DONE 

7. Code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directory. DONE

8. Pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. DONE

9. Include state abbreviations in the circles. NOT DONE -- SEE NOTE

10.  Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart. DONE

BONUS

11. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. DONE

12. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis. DONE FOR THREE.

13. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. DONE

14. Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file DONE

NOTE: I'd love advice about getting the State Abbreviations to attach to the circles. If you un-comment the code is app.js that is commented out, you'll see that I wrote code to attach the abbreviations, but there was a problem: only 29 or so of the labels appeared (alphbetically, from MA to the end of the list). At one point I had the existing abbrevs moving with the cicles, but I think I took this out in hope of trying to solve the issue. Neither I nor my tutor could figure out what was going on with this.
